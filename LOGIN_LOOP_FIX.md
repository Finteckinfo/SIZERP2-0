# Login Loop Fix - Implementation Details

## Problem
The application was experiencing a recurring login loop where users would be redirected to `/login` repeatedly, even after successful authentication.

## Root Cause
The login loop was caused by:
1. **API calls firing before Clerk authentication was ready** - Components were making API calls before `window.Clerk.session` was available
2. **Missing JWT tokens** - API calls were sent without proper `Authorization: Bearer <token>` headers
3. **Redirect loops** - 401 errors were triggering redirects even when already on auth pages
4. **No Clerk readiness checks** - No mechanism to wait for Clerk to be fully initialized

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced AuthService (`src/services/authService.ts`)
- Added `isRedirecting` flag to prevent multiple redirects
- Added `isClerkReady()` method to check Clerk session and user availability
- Enhanced `handleAuthError()` to prevent redirects when already on `/login` or `/register`
- Added redirect loop prevention with timeout-based flag reset

### 2. API Request Interceptor (`src/services/projectApi.ts`)
- Added Clerk readiness check before allowing any API requests
- Blocks API calls with clear error message when Clerk is not ready
- Prevents 401 errors from occurring due to missing authentication

### 3. Component-Level Guards
- **DefaultDashboard.vue**: Added Clerk readiness watchers before loading data
- **ProjectView.vue**: Added Clerk readiness watchers before loading project data
- Both components now wait for `user.value` AND `window.Clerk.session` before making API calls

### 4. Global Clerk Initialization (`src/main.ts`)
- Added global Clerk readiness check on app load
- Dispatches `clerk-ready` custom event when authentication is ready
- Sets global property `$clerkReady` for components to check

## How It Works Now

1. **App Load**: Clerk plugin initializes
2. **Clerk Ready Check**: Main.ts waits for `window.Clerk.session` and `window.Clerk.user`
3. **Component Mounting**: Components wait for Clerk readiness before making API calls
4. **API Requests**: All requests include proper JWT tokens from Clerk "API" template
5. **Error Handling**: 401 errors only redirect if not already on auth pages
6. **Loop Prevention**: Multiple redirects are prevented by the `isRedirecting` flag

## Key Benefits

✅ **No more login loops** - Components wait for authentication before API calls
✅ **Proper JWT handling** - All API calls include valid authentication headers
✅ **Graceful fallbacks** - Sample data shown while waiting for authentication
✅ **Better user experience** - No more redirect storms or authentication errors
✅ **Debugging support** - Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Open browser DevTools > Console
2. Navigate to the application
3. Check for "Clerk is ready" and "User authenticated" messages
4. Verify API calls include Authorization headers
5. Confirm no redirect loops occur

## Backend Requirements

The backend must still:
- Accept JWT tokens from Clerk "API" template
- Include required claims: `user_id`, `email`
- Use proper JWKS verification
- Return 401 only for authentication failures (not authorization)

## Files Modified

- `src/services/authService.ts` - Enhanced authentication service
- `src/services/projectApi.ts` - Added Clerk readiness interceptor
- `src/views/dashboards/default/DefaultDashboard.vue` - Added readiness watchers
- `src/views/projects/ProjectView.vue` - Added readiness watchers
- `src/main.ts` - Added global Clerk readiness check
